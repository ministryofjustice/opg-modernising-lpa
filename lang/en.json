    "beAnAttorneyContent": "<h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">What is an LPA?</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that lets someone (the ‘donor’) choose one or more trusted people (‘attorneys’) to make decisions on their behalf.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">What attorneys do</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">You can make decisions on someone’s behalf if they appoint you using a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney\" class=\"govuk-link\">lasting power of attorney</a> (LPA).</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The person who appoints you is called the ‘donor’. The person acting on the donor’s behalf is called the ‘attorney’.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The decisions you make will be for either the donor’s property and affairs or personal welfare, depending on the type of LPA they’ve made. They can choose you to be an attorney for both.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">You do not need any legal experience to act as someone’s attorney but you must understand what the donor’s LPA means and always:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>act based on the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and with consideration of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-capacity-act-code-of-practice\" class=\"govuk-link\">Mental Capacity Act code of practice</a></li><li>make any decisions in the donor’s best interests</li><li>help the donor make their own decisions as much as they can</li><li>follow any restrictions the donor put in their LPA</li><li>consider any conditions the donor put in their LPA</li></ul><p class=\"govuk-body\">Find out how to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-decisions-for-someone/making-decisions\" class=\"govuk-link\">make decisions for someone else</a> including how to get help making difficult decisions and act in someone’s best interests. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lasting-power-attorney-duties/checks-and-visits\" class=\"govuk-link\">Your decisions can be checked</a>.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">You cannot act as an attorney until the LPA has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Who can be an attorney</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">It’s up to the person making the LPA to choose their attorneys. They can have as many attorneys as they like. If there’s more than one attorney, the donor will state in their LPA how their attorneys should make decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Attorneys must:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>be aged 18 or over</li></li><li>not be on the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) barred list</li><li>not be a subject to an ongoing bankruptcy order or a debt relief order (for a property and financial affairs LPA only)</li></ul><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Replacement attorneys</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">The person making an LPA can choose people to step in if one of their original attorneys can no longer act. The OPG must be told if this happens so the LPA can be updated and can continue to be used.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Before you start</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">If you’ve been asked to be someone’s attorney, you’ll need:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>to sign in using GOV.UK One Login (the new way to sign in to all government services)</li><li>to provide some of your details, so we can check they match the information the donor has provided</li></ul><p class=\"govuk-body\">If you’ve not used GOV.UK One Login before, you can set up your account on the next page.</p>",
