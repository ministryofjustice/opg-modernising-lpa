If you want to, you can ask someone else to help you use the service. For example, a family member or a friend.</p> <p class=\"govuk-body\">Even if you get help, you will still need:</p> <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"> <li>your own account to use this service</li> <li>to make all the decisions about what goes on the LPA</li> </ul> <p class=\"govuk-body\">There is a different <a href=\"#\" class=\"govuk-link\">service for charities and solicitors who are supporting someone to make an LPA</a>.</p> <p class=\"govuk-body\">We’ll save the LPA as you progress so you do not need to complete it in one go. You can sign out at any time and come back later.</p> <p class=\"govuk-body\">It costs £82 to apply to register an LPA.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\"> This fee is for the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) to process your application.

You can apply to pay a half fee (known as a ‘remission’) or apply to have your fee waived (an ‘exemption’) in the payment section of this service.</p> <p class=\"govuk-body\">If you choose to apply for a remission or an exemption, you’ll need to provide evidence.</p> <p class=\"govuk-body\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"govuk-link\">Find out more about fees, remissions and exemptions.</a></p> </div> </details> <h2 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">What you’ll need</h2> <p class=\"govuk-body\">To use this online service, you’ll need:</p> <ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"> <li>a debit or credit card to pay the fee</li> <li>documents or information to confirm your identity with GOV.UK One Login</li> <li>an email address and a mobile phone, to access GOV.UK One Login</li> </ul> <details class=\"govuk-details\" data-module=\"govuk-details\"> <summary class=\"govuk-details__summary\"><span class=\"govuk-details__summary-text\">What you need to confirm your identity</span></summary> <div class=\"govuk-details__text\"> <p class=\"govuk-body\">When you make an LPA, we need to check your identity.

The person acting on the donor’s behalf is called the ‘attorney’.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The decisions you make will be for either the donor’s property and affairs or personal welfare, depending on the type of LPA they’ve made.

    "howMultipleAttorneysMakeDecisionsContent": "<p class=\"govuk-body\">If the <a href=\"#\" class=\"govuk-link\">donor</a> has more than one attorney or replacement attorney, they must decide how they want their attorneys to make decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The 3 options are explained below, with examples of how each option could work. If the donor is not sure which is best for their circumstances, they may want to get legal advice.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Bear in mind that, for every option, all the attorneys are legally responsible for every decision that is made on the donor’s behalf. This means that if the attorneys cannot collaborate together, the LPA will not work.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Adding restrictions and conditions </h2><p class=\"govuk-body\"><a href=\"{{ .AddingRestrictionsAndConditionsLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">Restrictions and conditions</a> can be used to modify the way the attorneys make decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The restrictions and conditions on this page are just examples – the donor should write them to suit their own needs.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Restrictions and conditions must be carefully planned and worded so they don’t contradict other parts of the LPA. The donor should take legal advice if they’re worried about the correct way to phrase them.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Jointly and severally: attorneys make decisions both together or on their own</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">Your attorneys can divide up tasks and responsibilities when making decisions on your behalf.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">It’s up to your attorneys to decide if they want to make a decision as a group (‘jointly’) or on their own (‘severally’), but the decisions they make must always be in your best interests.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Remember that all the attorneys are responsible for all decisions, even those taken by an attorney on their own.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">For example, an attorney might decide to book the donor into an expensive hair salon without consulting their fellow attorneys. They must be confident that this decision is in the donor’s best interests, and would be supported by their fellow attorneys, as they will also be held responsible for it.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Another example might be an attorney who is better at managing money and takes the lead on financial decisions, making them on their own. The other attorneys will still be held responsible for these decisions – claiming ignorance of them is not a defence.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Most people choose ‘jointly and severally’ because:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>attorneys can make simple or urgent decisions quickly and easily, without asking the donor’s other attorneys</li><li>if an attorney can no longer act, the LPA will not be cancelled</li></ul><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Jointly: attorneys must agree and act together on every decision</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">The attorneys must agree and must act together (‘jointly’) on all decisions, however big or small. For example, if money needs to be withdrawn from a bank, not only must all attorneys agree with this decision, but they must also be physically present when the money is withdrawn.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">With this option:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>meetings to discuss the donor’s care must take place with all the attorneys physically present</li><li>the attorneys may not be able to use internet or telephone banking to manage the donor’s bank accounts or pay bills</li><li>if the attorneys live far apart, they may find acting jointly impractical – for example, going to the bank together</li><li>if the attorneys fall out or one moves abroad, the LPA would not longer work</li></ul><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Restrictions and conditions on attorneys acting jointly</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">The law treats attorneys who act jointly as a single unit. This means that if an attorney dies or is unable or unwilling to act, the LPA will stop working.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">However, the donor can add restrictions and conditions to change this.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">For instance, the donor can state that if one of the joint attorneys can no longer act, the remaining joint attorneys can continue to make all decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Example restriction:</p><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘If one of my original joint attorneys, Jane Taylor or Robert Smith, is unable or unwilling to act, I then reappoint my remaining original attorney, Jane Taylor or Robert Smith, as attorney.’</p></div><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for others: attorneys must agree and act together for some decisions </h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">The attorneys must agree and must act together (‘jointly’) on some decisions, but are able to make other decisions on their own (‘jointly and severally’). If you choose this option, you must clearly state which decisions your attorneys should make together and all agree on: that is, when they should act ‘jointly’.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Remember that even when attorneys take decisions ‘on their own’, they must be confident they are in the donor’s best interests and would therefore have the support of the other attorneys.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">With this option:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>the donor specifies which decisions must be agreed and acted on together, with all attorneys physically present</li><li>for those decisions the donor specifies can be made by attorneys acting together or on their own, the attorneys will not need to be physically present</li></ul><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Restrictions and conditions on attorneys acting jointly for some decisions and jointly and severally for others</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">If an attorney dies or is unable or unwilling to act, the remaining attorneys will not be able to make any of the joint decisions, unless the donor has said otherwise in their restrictions and conditions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">For instance, the donor can state that if one of their attorneys can no longer act, the remaining attorneys can continue to make all the joint decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Example restriction:</p><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘If one of my original attorneys, Jane Taylor or Robert Smith, is unable or unwilling to act, I then reappoint my remaining original attorney, Jane Taylor or Robert Smith, to continue to make the decisions I have instructed should be made jointly.’</p></div><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor has also appointed replacement attorneys, the donor could add further restrictions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Example restriction:</p><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘If one of my replacement attorneys, Anne Brown or Chris Wilson, is unable or unwilling to act, I then reappoint my remaining replacement attorney, Anne Brown or Chris Wilson, to continue to make the decisions I have instructed should be made jointly.’</p></div><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Property and affairs restrictions and conditions on attorneys acting jointly for some decisions and jointly and severally for others</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">In these examples, ‘everything else’ means all other decisions about the donor’s property and affairs:</p><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about selling or letting my house and may act jointly and severally for everything else.’</p></div><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about investments in stocks and shares and may act jointly and severally for everything else.’</p></div><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Personal welfare restrictions and conditions on attorneys acting jointly for some decisions and jointly and severally for others</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">Example restrictions:</p><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about where I live and may act jointly and severally for everything else.’</p></div><div class=\"govuk-inset-text\"><p class=\"govuk-body\">‘My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions I have authorised them to make about life-sustaining treatment and may act jointly and severally for everything else.’</p></div><p class=\"govuk-body\">As the donor, you must be careful not to set restrictions and conditions that contradict your decisions about <a href=\"{{ .UnderstandingLifeSustainingTreatmentLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">life-sustaining treatment (LST)</a>.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">For example, you cannot decide that your attorneys cannot make decisions about LST, then add a restriction that says your attorneys must make LST decisions jointly.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Resolving disputes between attorneys</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">The donor should choose attorneys who work well together and can be trusted to act in the donor’s best interest. The donor should also share their wishes with the attorneys when they make their LPA.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">In the event that the attorneys cannot agree, they can <a href=\"{{ .ContactTheOfficeOfThePublicGuardianLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">contact The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)</a> for advice.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">If an agreement cannot be reached, attorneys must apply to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-protection\" class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Court of Protection</a>.

If they’re the only attorney and there are no <a href=\"{{ .ReplacementAttorneysLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">replacement attorneys</a>, this means the LPA can no longer be used.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">However, the donor can add <a href=\"{{ .AddingRestrictionsAndConditionsLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">restrictions and conditions</a> stating that their wife, husband or civil partner can continue to be their attorney after a divorce, dissolution or annulment.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Professional attorneys</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">Some donors ask a professional, such as a solicitor or accountant, to be their attorney or one of their attorneys.

They cannot just give a job title or the name of a firm.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Trust corporations</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">A trust corporation can be the attorney or one of the attorneys on a property and financial affairs LPA. A trust corporation manages funds, such as savings, pensions and investments. It’s usually run by a commercial bank or firm of solicitors.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor’s finances are complex or they do not have anyone they want to appoint as an attorney, they might choose a trust corporation. If they’re considering this, the donor should get legal or financial advice.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor appoints a trust corporation as their attorney, they must make sure they use the exact name it operates under in the LPA.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">The donor can only appoint one trust corporation in their LPA.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">When attorneys can no longer act</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">An attorney can no longer act if they:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>lose <a href=\"{{ .UnderstandingMentalCapacityLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">mental capacity</a></li><li>decide they no longer want to act as an attorney (known as ‘disclaiming their appointment’)</li><li>were the donor’s wife, husband or civil partner, but the relationship has legally ended (unless the donor states otherwise in their <a href=\"{{ .AddingRestrictionsAndConditionsLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">restrictions and conditions</a>)</li><li>become bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order and were an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA</li><li>are paid to act as an attorney, and are placed on the Disclosure and Barring Service barred list</li></ul><p class=\"govuk-body\">When an attorney dies or can no longer act, the LPA will be cancelled if:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>the donor only appointed one attorney and no <a href=\"{{ .ReplacementAttorneysLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">replacement attorneys</a></li><li>the donor appointed the attorneys jointly and did not appoint any replacements, unless the donor specified otherwise in their <a href=\"{{ .AddingRestrictionsAndConditionsLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">restrictions and conditions</a></li></ul><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor cancels their LPA, the attorneys can no longer act on the donor’s behalf.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Remove an attorney after the LPA has been registered</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">As long as the donor still has <a href=\"{{ .UnderstandingMentalCapacityLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">mental capacity</a>, they can contact OPG and ask for a particular attorney to be removed from their LPA.</p><h2 class=\"govuk-heading-l\">Concerns about attorneys</h2><p class=\"govuk-body\">The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) does not supervise attorneys.

Decisions on life-sustaining treatment can only be made by others if the donor does not have mental capacity.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor has an <a href=\"{{ .AdvanceDecisionLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">advance decision (opens in new tab)</a>, it’s important it isn’t contradicted by their decision about life-sustaining treatment.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\"><a href=\"{{ .LifeSustainingTreatmentLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">Learn more about life-sustaining treatment</a>.</p>",
    "glossary:M": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Mental capacity</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">A person with mental capacity is able to make a specific decision at the time it needs to be made. They will have at least some understanding of:</p><ul class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet\"><li>the decision they need to make</li><li>why they need to make it</li><li>any information relevant to the decision</li><li>what is likely to happen when they make it</li></ul><p class=\"govuk-body\"><a href=\"{{ .MentalCapacityLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\">Learn more about mental capacity</a>.</p><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Mental Capacity Act</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\"><a href=\"{{ .ExternalMentalCapacityLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 (opens in new tab)</a> covers people in England and Wales who can’t make some or all decisions for themselves because they lack mental capacity. The MCA is intended to protect vulnerable individuals and ensure decisions are made in their best interests.</p>",
    "glossary:N": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Notice of intent to register</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">When OPG has completed checks on a donor’s signed and submitted LPA, we send a notice of intent to register to the donor, their attorneys, their replacement attorneys and any people the donor has chosen to notify. A 4-week waiting period then begins. This is required by law, to allow anyone with objections to raise them.</p><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Notice of registration</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">At the end of the statutory 4-week waiting period to allow objections to be raised to the LPA, OPG registers the LPA. We send a notice of registration to the donor, their attorneys and their replacement attorneys.</p>",
    "glossary:O": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">OPG is the agency in England and Wales that registers LPAs and protects people who do not have mental capacity.</p><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">OPG</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">Acronym for Office of the Public Guardian.</p>",
    "glossary:P": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">People to notify</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">The donor can choose people to be told when the applicant applies to register the LPA. We call these ‘people to notify’. Having people to notify is optional.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">People to notify provide extra security as they get a chance to raise any concerns about the LPA before it’s registered – for example, if they believe the donor has been put under pressure to make it.</p><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Public Guardian</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">The Public Guardian is the chief executive of the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). You can find details of the current Public Guardian by <a href=\"{{ .OPGGovernanceLink }}\" class=\"govuk-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">visiting OPG’s governance page (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>",

    "glossary:R": "<p class=\"govuk-body\"><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Registration</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">An LPA must be registered with OPG before it can be used. The following steps must be completed before registration.</p><ol class=\"govuk-list govuk-list--number\"><li>The LPA must be filled in and signed by the donor, witnessed by the certificate provider.</li><li>The LPA must be submitted to OPG, so we can check it’s been made correctly and there’s nothing that would make it invalid or unworkable.</li><li>OPG will ask the certificate provider to provide a certificate for the LPA, and the attorneys to sign the LPA.</li><li>OPG will inform any people the donor has asked us to notify.</li><li>A 4-week waiting period will begin – this is required by law, to allow anyone with objections to raise them.</li><li>If no objections are raised, the LPA will be registered by OPG.</li></ol><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Remission</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">If the donor has an income of less than £12,000 a year before tax, they can apply to pay less to register their LPA. This is known as a ‘remission’. Also see ‘Exemption’.</p><h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Replacement attorneys</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">Replacement attorneys are people the donor chooses to step in if one or more of their attorneys can no longer act or make decisions.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">Replacement attorneys cannot act without the authorisation of the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).</p>",
    "glossary:S": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Severance</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">If one or more of the restrictions or conditions a donor has added to an LPA are contradicted by their other instructions, or are illegal, the LPA will not work. An LPA cannot be amended once it has been signed by the donor, so it’s usually quicker to make a new LPA – OPG charges a reduced fee for this if the application is made within 3 months.</p><p class=\"govuk-body\">However, if the donor does not wish to make an LPA, or has lost mental capacity OPG can apply to the Court of Protection. The court has the power to ‘sever’ the restriction or condition which is stopping the LPA from working. It can then be used by the donor’s attorneys.</p>",
    "glossary:T": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Trust corporation</h3>\n<p class=\"govuk-body\">A trust corporation can be an attorney on a property and affairs LPA. A trust corporation manages the donor’s funds, including savings, pensions or investments. A trust corporation is usually run by a commercial bank or firm of solicitors. The donor cannot appoint more than one trust corporation in their LPA.</p>",

The person they ask must be able to confirm their own identity using GOV.UK One Login, and must then sign a declaration verifying the donor’s identity.</p>",
    "glossary:W": "<h3 class=\"govuk-heading-m\">Witness</h3><p class=\"govuk-body\">Witnesses are impartial people who watch the attorneys and any replacement attorneys sign the LPA. The witnesses must also sign the LPA to say they’ve seen the attorneys and replacement attorneys sign.</p>",
