# OPG Modernising LPA Documentation

## Modernising Lasting Power of Attorney Documentation Site

* [Public facing site](https://docs.modernising.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/)
* [Github repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-modernising-lpa-docs/)

ADRs and Research should be published in our dedicated Modernising Lasting Power of Attorney Documentation site rather than in this repository.

This enables us to maintain our documentation in a central place in case we build multiple separate repositories for this service.

## What should be recorded in this repository

More context specific documentation should be stored in this repository. Examples of this are OpenAPI documentation and [runbooks](./runbooks/README.md) which help others to understand how to use the codebase.

## Runbooks

A full list of runbooks can be found in the [/runbooks/](./runbooks/README.md) directory.
